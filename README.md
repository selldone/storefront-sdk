# Starter

## Installation

To install Selldone Core in your project, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @selldone/sdk-storefront
```

```bash
yarn add @selldone/sdk-storefront
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started:

### Use in Vue, React, Bootstrap, or any other JS Framework

```javascript
import {StorefrontSDK} from "@selldone/sdk-storefront";

// ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ Storefront SDK (xapi,...) ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
StorefrontSDK.Setup(); // Set up the Shop SDK.
```

### Use in Html

```html  

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@selldone/sdk-storefront@1.0.12/dist/bundle.min.js"></script>
<script>
    // Use the global variable StorefrontSDK
    const sdk = storefront.StorefrontSDK;
    sdk.Setup()
</script>
```

‚ö° Change `1.0.12` to last version: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@selldone/sdk-storefront"><img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@selldone/sdk-storefront.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Version"></a>

### Add Meta Tags to HTML

To integrate your web application with the Selldone ecosystem effectively, it's essential to embed specific meta tags
within the <head> section of your HTML. These tags enable the Selldone SDK to establish a connection with the Selldone
API, facilitating the retrieval of your shop's data.

```html
<!-- üè¨ Shop Name -->
<meta name="shop-name" content="toysworld">

<!-- üéó Prefix address of app Ex./my-shop-path -->
<meta name="shop-prefix-address" content="">

<!-- üì∞ Shop custom page -->
<meta name="custom-home" content="shop">


<!-- ‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï Start ‚ùØ Business OS Configuration ‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï -->

<!-- ü™Å Service Origin -->
