# ✨ Selldone Page Builder — AI Material Pack

This folder contains **sample Vue sections** and **instructions** for AI tools and LLM-based assistants.
They are designed to teach models **how to generate visual, dynamic sections** for the **Selldone Page Builder** (using Vue + Vuetify).

If you’re using **[Selldone GPT on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Bp0vE4zIR-selldone)** or any other AI model,
these files should be used as **reference material** (AI training data) to help the model understand how Selldone sections are structured, styled, and connected to the storefront APIs.

Each file includes:

* ✅ Real Vue component samples
* ⚙️ API usage examples (Storefront / CDN)
* 🎨 Design and responsive layout patterns

Use this folder as **AI-readable material** when training or prompting models to build Selldone Page Builder components.

Would you like me to also include a short metadata footer (like `keywords` and `purpose`) to make it more machine-readable for embedding or dataset tagging?
