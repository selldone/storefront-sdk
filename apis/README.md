## XAPI Documentation

### Constructor Overview

The constructor provided is designed to find and assign the `content` value of a specific `<meta>` tag from a document's head section to a property. This tag is used to determine the API endpoint for a service.

### Usage

When creating an instance of the class containing this constructor, it will automatically search the HTML document's `<head>` section for a `<meta>` tag with the `name` attribute set to "selldone-xapi".

If this tag is found, its `content` value (which should be a URL) will be assigned to the `selldone_xapi_url` property of the instance.

### Example

Consider an HTML document with the following head:

```html
<head>
  <meta name="selldone-xapi" content="https://xapi.example.com">
  ...
</head>
```

When the constructor runs, it will set:

```javascript
this.selldone_xapi_url = "https://xapi.example.com";
```

### Default

If the `<meta>` tag is not found, the `selldone_xapi_url` property will not be set by this constructor. In such scenarios, it is assumed that the default API endpoint is `xapi.selldone.com`. Implementers should handle this default setting in subsequent code or methods to ensure proper functionality.
